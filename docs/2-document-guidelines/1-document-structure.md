## Encoding

- Ensure that proper character encoding is used. The UTF-8 character encoding is used universally, and is the preferred form of encoding.
- Unicode encoding is preferred because of its single character encoding, by which you can handle any specific character that is needed. Using Unicode throughout your system also removes the need to track and convert between various character encodings.
- Both developers and writers should use UTF-8 character encoding to ensure uniformity and eliminate inaccuracies in their content.
- Read more about encoding [here](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding).
