# Writing documentation for an international audience

WordPress is a global project, with the majority of users being non-native English speakers. Approaching documentation from a global perspective helps the understanding of readers around the globe. Both developer and end-user WordPress documentation is written in US English. Just about [half of WordPress installs](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are in non-English locales. Hence writing documentation considering internationalization, localization, and translation is essential.
