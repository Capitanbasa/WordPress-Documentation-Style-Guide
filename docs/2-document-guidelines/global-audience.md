# Writing documentation for an international audience

WordPress is a global project, with its developer community and users spanning the globe. Approaching documentation from a global perspective helps the understanding of readers around the globe; while also increasing its reach.

Both developer and end-user WordPress documentation is written in US English. Just about [half of WordPress installs](https://wordpress.org/about/stats/) are in non-English locales. Additionally, documentation is read by developers and users for whom English is not their primary language. Hence writing documentation considering internationalization, localization, and translation is essential.
