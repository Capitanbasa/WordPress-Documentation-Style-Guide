Anything that the reader must know or do needs to be in text, too, not just in images.
alt text for images

## General Do's and Don'ts
- Use approved terminology for people with specific disabilities.
- Maintain a uniform structure for your document.
- Take a pragmatic approach to HTML semantics. Don’t add semantics purely for the sake of semantics; but if there is an HTML structure that clearly matches the content, use that element. For example, if you have a group of links, it should most likely use a list element.
- Use simple tables and tabular formats. Avoid span tags (such as rowspan and colspan)

## Text Accessibility
- Avoid camel case and all caps text; follow capitalization guidelines.
- Use proper heading hierarchy. The H1 is the main heading representing the page title on every core page. For subsections, use a reasonable HTML heading structure — including the use of heading elements for page subsections. Heading markup should not be used for presentational purposes.
 - Use H2 through H6 to give internal structure to the page.
 - Don’t skip heading levels.
 - Don’t add extra functionality inside a heading, like links or buttons.
- Don't used colored or shaded backgrounds, images, or watermarks behind text. Low contrast hinders screen readers.
- Avoid a screen full of continued text; rather break up your content in paragraphs and make use of headings, lists, bullet points, etc.
- Define and spell out symbols or abbreviations.
