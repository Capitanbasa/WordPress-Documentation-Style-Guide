put the person first
use approved terminology for people with specific disabilities.

Anything that the reader must know or do needs to be in text, too, not just in images.

## General Do's and Don'ts
- Take a pragmatic approach to HTML semantics. Don’t add semantics purely for the sake of semantics; but if there is an HTML structure that clearly matches the content, use that element. For example, if you have a group of links, it should most likely use a list element.

## Reading Accessibility
avoid camel case, all caps, follow Capitalization guidelines.
Don’t use screened or shaded backgrounds, watermarks, or other images behind text. Reduced contrast makes text harder to read and hinders screen readers.
no continuous text - break up in paragraphs, bullet points, headings, lists
color contrast
spell out symbols/abbreviations
uniform document structure
Heading hierarchy
use
