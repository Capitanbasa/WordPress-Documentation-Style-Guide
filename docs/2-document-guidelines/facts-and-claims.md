# Avoid excessive claims

Avoid making excessive claims about WordPress' products and services. Abide with proven facts as frequently as possible. If you are unsure about some details, research about it. Reach out to the respective people via the communication channels for further clarifications.

## Avoid ambiguities
If a particular fact is not verified or proven, don't go into ambiguities. Substantiate facts without exception, and then publish them to your document.
