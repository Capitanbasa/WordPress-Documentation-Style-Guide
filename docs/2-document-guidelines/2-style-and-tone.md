# Style and Tone

Always write your documents in simple, easy-to-understand sentences. Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader. Avoid a tone that is commanding or too pushy. Try to keep the document contents straightforward and effortless to understand.

Don't try to be overly colloquial. On the other hand, a formal/robotic tone is unfit as well. Try to achieve a balance between colloquial and formal language, that is suitable for providing knowledge and information. The document should persuade readers,

Even if a conversational tone helps, don't overplay the humor part. Keep the emphasis on the reader; the reader should not feel out of place. WordPress is a global project, with the majority of users being non-native English speakers. Hence, take into consideration that your document may be translated into other languages. Ultimately, providing information to the reader is of the utmost priority.

### Try to avoid these things:
- Colloquial or idiomatic expressions.
- Unnecessary metaphors or humor.
- Ableist language or figures of speech.
- Technical jargon/slang.
- Shortcuts, symbols, and abbreviations that could easily be spelled out.
- Being overly pretentious/conspicuous.
- Dictating/ordering procedures.
- Using exclamation marks unless absolutely needed.
- Long and complicated sentences.
- Content that would insult any group or individual.
- Assumptions on the reader's fundamental understandings.
- Unorthodox conventions.
- Heavily biased and disparaging information.

Failure to do so could result in increased document perplexity and the reader having difficulties.

### Things that are encouraged:
- Proof-reading the document.
- Using transition words like *Moreover a*
- Use active voice wherever possible.
