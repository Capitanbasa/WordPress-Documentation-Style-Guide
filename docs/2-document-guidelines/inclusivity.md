# Writing inclusive documentation

The WordPress community is welcoming and inclusive. Write WordPress documentation considering inclusivity of all people.

## Unbiased documentation

Write documentation that is unbiased towards the reader and any kind of person in general. While documenting particularly demanding/sensitive topics, take the time to educate yourself thoroughly. Ensure that your document doesn't have content that may hurt or offend someone unintentionally.  

While writing unbiased documentation:
 - Be inclusive of gender identity, race, culture, ability, age, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic class. Include a wide variety of professions, educational settings, locales, and economic settings in examples.
 - Avoid politicized content. In case, that is to be included, remain neutral.
 - Follow Accessibility guidelines.
 - Avoid content that would insult or cause harm to people.
 - Don't write prejudiced and discriminatory content against minority communities.  





## Language guidelines
- Be thoughtful of word choice - particularly slang and ableist language.
