# Prefixes and suffixes

A *prefix* is a letter or group of letters that are attached to the beginning of a word, whereas similarly, a *suffix* is attached to the end of a word. Attaching a prefix or suffix to a word is called *affixing*.

**Examples**
Prefixes
- *anti-, de-, dis-*
- *en-, em-, fore-*
- *in-, im-, in-, im-, il-, ir-, inter-*
mid-, mis-
non-
over-
pre-
re-
semi-, sub-, super-
trans-
un-
under-

## General do's and don'ts

- Make sure to use affixes along with words rather than using them separately as individual words.
