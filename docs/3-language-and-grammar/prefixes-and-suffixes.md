# Prefixes and suffixes

A *prefix* is a letter or group of letters that are attached to the beginning of a word, whereas similarly, a *suffix* is attached to the end of a word. Attaching a prefix or suffix to a word is called *affixing*.

- Some affixes can be complete words too. Make sure to use affixes along with words rather than using them separately as individual words.
