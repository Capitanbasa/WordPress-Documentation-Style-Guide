# Tense

In general, write in the present tense rather than future tense. Occasionally in some cases, future tense is needed while writing about the expected behavior of something in the future. An example of this is, "After clicking **Run**, you will see the updated window in 10 seconds." Therefore, use future tense only when absolutely needed.

Don't document WordPress' future features, products, or services unless explicitly specified. For more information, refer "Facts and Claims".
