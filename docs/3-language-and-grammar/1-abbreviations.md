- An initialism is formed from the initial letters of words from a particular phrase, but each letter is pronounced separately.
  - HTML - *Hyper Text Markup Language*.
  - PST - *Pacific Standard Time*.
  - IMO - *In My Opinion*.
  - FAQ - *Frequently Asked Questions*.
- A contraction is a short form of a word or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English.
