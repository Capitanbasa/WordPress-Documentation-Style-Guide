# Abbreviations

Abbreviations include acronyms, initialisms, contractions, and shortened phrases and words.

- An acronym is formed from the initial letters of words from a particular phrase. Acronyms are pronounced as words themselves.
  - Laser - *Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation*.
  - Radar - *Radio detection and ranging*.
  - LAN - *Local Area Network*.
  - CRUD - *Create, Read, Update, Delete*.
- An initialism is formed from the initial letters of words from a particular phrase, but each letter is pronounced separately.
  - HTML - *Hyper Text Markup Language*.
  - PST - *Pacific Standard Time*.
  - USB - *Universal Serial Bus*.
  - IMO - *In My Opinion*.
- A contraction is a short form of a word or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English.
  - I'm - *I am*.
  - they've - *they have*.
  - Additional information on "Contractions".
- A shortened word or phrase is part of the word or phrase, but condensed; sometimes with a period at the end.
  - Dr. - *Doctor*.
  - Rd. - *Road*.
  - etc. - *et cetera*.
  - min - *minutes*.
- Sometimes the long and short versions of a word are used interchangeably. These words don't need a period at the end.
  - max - *Maximum*.
  - info - *Information*.
  - app - *Application*.
  - uni - *University*.

Some words often have concurrent characteristics of acronyms, initialisms, or shortened words. Words like GUI, GIF could be either spoken as an acronym or an initialism; subject to preference of the speaker.

## Spelling out and declaring abbreviations

Spell out and declare abbreviations whenever they are used for the first time in a document. Avoid using abbreviations in titles and headings, unless absolutely necessary. If using an abbreviation in a heading/title is mandatory, spell out the abbreviation in the succeeding body text.
Upon successive mentions of the abbreviation in the document, you can use the abbreviation without spelling it out.

Consider your audience while defining or spelling-out an abbreviation. Some abbreviations like PC, RAM, USB, PDF are more well-known than their spelled-out terms. If you're sure that your reader demographic is expected to understand the term, then you don't need to spell it out. 

## Abbreviations to be avoided

- If an acronym appears only once in your document, just spell out the term. Don't introduce it in parentheses after the spelled-out version.
- Avoid internet slang abbreviations such as tbh (*to be honest*), fwiw (*for what it's worth*), tl;dr (*too long; didn't read*). Rephrase the sentence in an objective approach.
