# Word Choice

Choose words that enhance readability and increase simplicity in your documentation.
For more information on writing simple, easy-to-understand documentation, refer "Style and Tone".

## Spelling

In general, use American (US) English. When the spelling of English words differ by locale, use the US spelling.
If you're doubtful of a particular word, first refer the "Word List"; if it's not covered there, refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: British/Commonwealth English: aluminium, analyse, centre, colour, licence, programme, realise. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: US English: aluminum, analyze, center, color, license, program, realize. [/tip]

For an overview of locale-wise English spellings, refer the [Spelling section of Wikipedia's Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling)

## Avoid jargon and slang

Be thoughtful of word choice - particularly avoid jargon, slang and ableist language. In a spoken and informal context, slang or jargon would suffice. But for achieving inclusive and accessible documentation for a global audience, slang and jargon hinders understanding more than simplifying it.
