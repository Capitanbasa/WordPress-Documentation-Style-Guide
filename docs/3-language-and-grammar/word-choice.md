## Spelling

In general, when the spelling of English words differ by locale, use the US spelling. If you're doubtful of a particular word, first refer the "Word List"; if it's not covered there, refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).
