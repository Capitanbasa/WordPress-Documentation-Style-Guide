## Spelling

In general, use American (US) English. When the spelling of English words differ by locale, use the US spelling.
If you're doubtful of a particular word, first refer the "Word List"; if it's not covered there, refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: US English: aluminum, analyze, center, color, program, realize. [/tip]
