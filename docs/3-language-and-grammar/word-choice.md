# Word Choice

Choose words that enhance readability and increase simplicity in your documentation.
For more information on writing simple, easy-to-understand documentation, refer "Style and Tone".

## Spelling

In general, use American (US) English. When the spelling of English words differ by locale, use the US spelling.
If you're doubtful of a particular word, first refer the "Word List"; if it's not covered there, refer the [American Heritage Dictionary](https://ahdictionary.com/) and [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/).

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: British/Commonwealth English: aluminium, analyse, centre, colour, licence, programme, realise. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: US English: aluminum, analyze, center, color, license, program, realize. [/tip]

For an overview of locale-wise English spellings, refer the [Spelling section of Wikipedia's Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style/Spelling)

## Technical terms

Technical terms can vary from everyday words like net, bit, cloud, virus to proprietary terms such as processor, URL, website, bandwidth, that are specific to technical concepts. Many technical terms are sometimes portmanteau words - a word that results from blending two or more words such as *WiFi, favicon, email, freeware,* and *webinar*. 


## Avoid jargon and slang

Be thoughtful of word choice - particularly avoid jargon, slang and ableist language. In a spoken and informal context, slang or jargon would suffice. But for achieving inclusive and accessible documentation for a global audience, slang and jargon hinders understanding more than simplifying it. Instead of using slang or jargon, use common and easy-to-understand terms.

Avoid using jargon if there is a better, comprehensible word for that specific term. Additionally, don't use jargon if the term is familiar to only a small portion of your reader demographic. Only use jargon if it is absolutely needed to explain technical or software-related concepts.

If you're doubtful of whether a particular term is jargon or a technical term, refer the "Word List"; if it isn't covered there, refer technical or industry publications for demonstration of common use. A particular term likely is jargon if you, your colleague, or reviewer thinks that it might be jargon. If the term is an "abbreviation" and you're sure that your reader demographic is expected to understand the term, then you don't need to spell it out. Otherwise spell out abbreviations.
