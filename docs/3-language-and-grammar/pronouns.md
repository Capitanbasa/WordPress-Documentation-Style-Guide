# Pronouns

A pronoun is a word that is used as a substitute for a noun or a noun phrase, which are contextually understood. Pronouns are used so that a particular noun isn't repeatedly used.

## Ambiguities using Pronouns

Ensure that the pronoun you're using is referencing its antecedent (the noun that it's replacing) clearly.

## Pronouns and gender

Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person being referred actually uses that gender. If you're unsure which gender-specific pronoun to use, rewrite the sentence using second person (*you*).

Use gender-neutral pronouns while particularly avoiding binary pronouns such as *he, him, she, her, or renditions like s/he, he/she, or (s)he*.
Instead, use *they* as a gender-neutral pronoun.
