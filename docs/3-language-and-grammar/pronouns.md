# Pronouns and genders

Don't use gender-specific pronouns unless the person being referred actually uses that gender. If you're unsure which gender-specific pronoun to use, rewrite the sentence using second person (*you*).

Use gender-neutral pronouns while particularly avoiding binary pronouns such as *he, him, she, her, or renditions like s/he, he/she, or (s)he*.
Instead, use *they* as a gender-neutral pronoun.
