# Direct and indirect speech

In documentation, often times you have to convey what someone has expressed to the reader. This can be done in two methods, direct speech or indirect speech.

## Direct speech

In direct speech, the speaker's words are directly quoted word-to-word.

## Indirect or reported speech

In indirect or reported speech, the speaker's words are reported by paraphrasing or summarizing. Unlike direct speech, they are not quoted directly.

**Example**

Developer's expression: This API is the newest version available.
Indirect speech: The developer asserted that this API is the newest version that is available.
