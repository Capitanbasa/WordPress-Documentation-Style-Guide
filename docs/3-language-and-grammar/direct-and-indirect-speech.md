# Direct and indirect speech

In documentation, often times you have to convey what someone has expressed to the reader. This can be done in two methods, direct speech or indirect speech. In general, use indirect speech so that readers don't have to distinguish between speakers and their quotes.

## Direct speech

In direct speech, the speaker's words are directly quoted word-to-word. The words that are spoken by the speaker are enclosed in inverted commas with a comma before the initial inverted comma.

**Example**  
Developer's expression: This API is the newest version.  
Indirect speech: The developer said, "This API is the newest version".

## Indirect or reported speech

In indirect or reported speech, the speaker's words are reported by paraphrasing or summarizing. Unlike direct speech, they are not quoted directly.

**Example**  
Developer's expression: This API is the newest version.  
Indirect speech: The developer asserted that this API is the newest version.
