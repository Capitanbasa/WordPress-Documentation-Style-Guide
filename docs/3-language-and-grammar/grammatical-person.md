# Grammatical person

Grammatical *person* is used to refer to different people in a statement, and describe the verbs and pronouns that refer them.

Briefly, the first person refers to the person speaking (*I, we*), the second person refers to the person being spoken to (*you*), and the third person refers to another person or thing being spoken about (*he, she, it, they*).

## Second person

In general, use second person in your documentation. Second person depicts a friendly tone, with a perfect focus on the reader. In addition to this, directly addressing the reader helps avoid passive voice; thereby preventing unwanted confusion.

## First person

Use first person (*I, we*) only when absolutely needed. First person may be used in quotes, direct references, and personifications. First person plurals such as *we* may intimidate the reader in some cases. Try to avoid first person plural, but be cautious if you're using them.
