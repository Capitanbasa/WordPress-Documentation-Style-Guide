# Clauses

Conditional sentences consist of a main clause and a conditional clause. The conditional clause, also known as the if-clause, begins with an *if* or *unless*. The conditional clause can come before or after the main clause.  
For example,
- The console will show an error, if you use the old API.
- If you use the old API, the console will show an error.

In this particular example, the reader would have to read the entire sentence to interpret it. If the reader isn't using the *old API*, they can skip the instruction, if needed. Therefore, put conditional clauses before instructions (main clauses), rather than after them.
