# Clauses

Conditional sentences consist of a main clause and a conditional clause. The conditional clause, also known as the if-clause, begins with an *if* or *unless*. The conditional clause can come before or after the main clause.

For example,
- The console will show an error, if you use the old API.
- If you use the old API, the console will show an error.
