# Articles (a, an, the)

Articles modify nouns. *The* is a definite article, and is used to define specific or particular nouns.
*A* and *an* are indefinite articles, and are used to define non-specific or non-particular nouns.

For example, 'I watched *the* video.' Here, *the* particular video is being watched.
'I watched *a* video.' Here, it may be any video that may be watched.

Including articles in your writing is essential for overall simplicity of language and ease of understanding.
