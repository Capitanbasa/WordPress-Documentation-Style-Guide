# Plurals


## Plurals and abbreviations
Don't use apostrophes to form plurals of abbreviations. The plural of an abbreviation can be formed like any other regular term; if the abbreviation is for a singular noun, add a lowercase *s* to form its plural. If the abbreviation is for a plural noun, don't add an *s*. Examples include APIs, CMSs, IDEs. Also ensure that the possessive form of the word (an apostrophe *'* before the *s*) is not used. For additional information, refer "Abbreviations".
