# Plurals



## Plurals and abbreviations

Don't use apostrophes to form plurals of abbreviations. The plural of an abbreviation can be formed like any other regular term; if the abbreviation is for a singular noun, add a lowercase *s* to form its plural. If the abbreviation is for a plural noun, don't add an *s*. Examples include APIs, CMSs, IDEs. Also ensure that the possessive form of the word (an apostrophe *'* before the *s*) is not used. For additional information, refer "Abbreviations".

## Plurals in parentheses

Don't put optional plurals in parentheses, but rather use either the plural or singular form of the word. Determine a word form that is most appropriate for your documentation and stay consistent with its usage. If it is essential to indicate both, use *one or more*.
