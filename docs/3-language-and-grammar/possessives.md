# Possessives

A singular or plural noun is transformed to its possessive form to show its ownership or possession.
To form a possessive of a singular or plural noun, add *'s* to the end of the word. This is regardless of whether the singular noun ends with an *s* or if the plural noun doesn't end with an *s*. Most plurals already end with an *s*; for these plurals, add an apostrophe at the end without an additional *s*.
