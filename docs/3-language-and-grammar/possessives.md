# Possessives

A singular or plural noun is transformed to its possessive form to show its ownership or possession.
To form a possessive of a singular or plural noun, add *'s* to the end of the word. This is regardless of whether the singular noun ends with an *s* or if the plural noun doesn't end with an *s*. Most plurals already end with an *s*; for these plurals, add an apostrophe at the end without an additional *s*.

**Examples**  

Singular nouns
- John's car.
- Buzz's laptop.
- application's password.
- bus's brakes.
- business's manager.
- Chris's key or Chris' key.
- Mr. Williams's suitcase or Mr. Williams' suitcase.  

Exception: If a proper noun ends with an *s*, you can either use an apostrophe and *s* or just an apostrophe.

Plural nouns
- computers' keyboards.
- buses' parking.
- scissors' handles.
- business' earnings.
- The Jones' family.
- Williams' house.
