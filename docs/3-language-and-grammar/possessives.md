# Possessives

A singular or plural noun is transformed to its possessive form to show its ownership or possession.
To form a possessive of a singular or plural noun, add *'s* to the end of the word. This is regardless of whether the singular noun ends with an *s* or if the plural noun doesn't end with an *s*. Most plurals already end with an *s*; for these plurals, add an apostrophe at the end without an additional *s*.

**Examples**  

Singular nouns
- John's software
- Buzz's laptop
- application's password
- bus's architecture
- business's manager
- class's description
- Chris's key or Chris' key
- Mr. Williams's suitcase or Mr. Williams' suitcase  

**Exception:** If a proper noun ends with an *s*, you can either use an apostrophe and *s* or just an apostrophe.  
**Exception:** The possessive of *it* is *its* and doesn't have an apostrophe. Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *its* with *it's* (a contraction for *it is*).

Plural nouns
- computers' keyboards
- buses' architecture
- arrays' elements
- business' earnings
- classes' declaration
- Jones' programs
- Williams' websites

## Company, product, and brand names

Add an apostrophe and *s* to the end of a company, product, or brand name. In general, avoid forming possessives of company, product or brand names, regardless of who owns the name.
