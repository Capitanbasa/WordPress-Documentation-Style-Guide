# Voice

In general, use active voice rather than passive voice. When the subject (person or thing) of a sentence is performing the action, the sentence uses active voice. When the subject (person or thing) of a sentence is being acted upon, then the sentence uses passive voice. Active voice is more effective than passive voice and reduces the word count of a sentence. In sentences using passive voice, it may be difficult inferring who or what the subject is.

Sometimes passive voice may be more appropriate for a sentence. Be careful not change the meaning of a sentence while rewriting it from active voice to passive voice.

Passive voice can be used when:
- The object needs to be emphasized.
- If the sentence does not need a subject, or if the subject is not the focus of the sentence.
- Active voice creates a cumbersome sentence structure.
- The systems performs and action.
- You want to avoid blaming the reader.
