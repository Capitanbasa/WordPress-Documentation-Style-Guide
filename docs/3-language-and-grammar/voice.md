# Voice

When the subject (person or thing) of a sentence is performing the action, the sentence uses active voice. When the subject (person or thing) of a sentence is being acted upon, then the sentence uses passive voice.

In general, use active voice rather than passive voice.

Sometimes passive voice may be more suitable for a sentence. Be careful not change the meaning of a sentence while rewriting it from active voice to passive voice.
