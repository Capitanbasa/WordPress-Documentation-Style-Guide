# Capitalization

WordPress follows American English capitalization rules. In general, sentence case capitalization is used. Sentence case capitalization means capitalizing the first word of a sentence or a phrase and the proper nouns.

## General do's and don'ts

- Capitalize the first word of a sentence, phrase, heading, title, or any element.
- Always capitalize proper nouns. Proper nouns include, names, brand names, organizations, companies, software, products, services, and whatever the organizations deem to be capitalized. Use lowercase for everything else.
- If an official name, term, abbreviation, or code snippet begins with a lowercase, is all-uppercase, or a mix of both uppercase and lowercase, then don't alter it.
- Rephrase sentences that start with a lowercase term to avoid the lowercase term in the beginning.
- Don't capitalize words unnecessarily. If in doubt, don't capitalize the term.
- Don't use all-uppercase for emphasizing text. Also, don't use all-lowercase as a design preference. In both instances, text is difficult to read and it becomes difficult to distinguish between sentences.
- Avoid camel case, except while representing code or official terminology.
- While referencing or quoting external sources, use the original capitalization. Don't alter the capitalization even if it is incorrect.

## Capitalization in titles and headings

Use sentence-case capitalization in titles and headings. Capitalize the first word in the title or heading, sub-heading, any proper nouns, and official terms. Don't end the title or heading with a period.
