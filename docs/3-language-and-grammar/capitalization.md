# Capitalization

WordPress follows American English capitalization rules. In general, sentence case capitalization is used. Sentence case capitalization means capitalizing the first word of a sentence or a phrase and the proper nouns.

## General Do's and Don'ts

- Capitalize the first word of a sentence, phrase, heading, title, or any element.
- Always capitalize proper nouns. Proper nouns include, names, brand names, organizations, companies, software, products, services, and whatever the organizations deem to be capitalized. Use lowercase for everything else.
- If an official name, term, or abbreviation begins with a lowercase, is all-uppercase, or a mix of both uppercase and lowercase, then don't alter it.
- Rephrase the sentence so that it doesn't start with a lowercase term.
- Don't capitalize words unnecessarily. If in doubt, don't capitalize the term.
- Don't use all-uppercase.
-  
- Avoid camel case, except while representing code or official terminology.
- Follow the capitalization guidelines for "Hyphens".
