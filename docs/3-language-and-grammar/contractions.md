# Contractions

A contraction is a shortened form of a word, syllable, or a phrase. It is a short form of a word or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English. Generally, the letters omitted by contractions are indicated with an apostrophe ( *'* ).  Contractions are commonly used in colloquial and informal settings.

As WordPress documentation makes use of a colloquial tone, you can utilize contractions in your content. Although, be watchful of some exceptions.
