# Contractions

A contraction is a shortened form of a word, syllable, or a combination of words that is often used instead of the full form in spoken English. Generally, the letters omitted by contractions are indicated with an apostrophe ( *'* ).  Contractions are commonly used in colloquial and informal settings.

As WordPress documentation makes use of a colloquial tone, you can utilize contractions in your content. Although, be watchful of some exceptions.

## Common contractions

Use common contractions such as *they're, that's, you're, it's*, in your documentation.
Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *you're* with *your*, and *it's* with *its*.
