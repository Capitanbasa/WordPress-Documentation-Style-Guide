# Commas

## Oxford/Serial commas

Use the Oxford comma before the conjunction in a series of three or more items.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural and friendly towards the reader. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Ensure that your tone is succinct, natural, and friendly towards the reader. [/tip]

## Commas following an introductory phrase

Use a comma after an introductory word or phrase.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Ultimately this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Ultimately, this simplifies the reader's comprehension. [/tip]

## Commas separating two independent clauses

Use a comma to join two independent clauses which are separated by a conjunction such as *and, or, nor, but, for, so, yet.* Insert the comma after the first clause, that is before the conjunction. Don't insert a comma if both the clauses are very short.

**Examples**

[warning] Not Recommended: Copy the file, and continue.[/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Copy the file and continue. [/tip]

[warning] Not Recommended: Either download a theme suiting your needs or use one from the preinstalled themes. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: Either download a theme suiting your needs, or use one that is preinstalled. [/tip]

## Commas separating independent from dependent clauses

When an independent and dependent clause are separated by a coordinating conjunction, insert a comma *only if* the sentence could be misunderstood without one.

**Examples**

[tip] Recommended: Pages can be password protected, and can only be modified by administrators. [/tip]
