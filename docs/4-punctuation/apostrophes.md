# Apostrophes

Use curved apostrophes, the same character as a single quotation mark ('). Only use straight apostrophes in code snippets.

## Apostrophes in contractions

## Apostrophes in plurals

## Apostrophes in possessives

Use an apostrophe to form the possessive case of nouns. To form the possessive case of a singular noun, add an apostrophe and an *s*, even if the noun ends with an *-s, -x,* or *-z*. For plurals ending with an *-s*, add an apostrophe only.

**Examples**  
- John's software
- Buzz's laptop
- application's password
- bus's architecture
- class's description
- CSS's file
- OEMs' products
- business' earnings
- classes' declaration
- Jones' programs

**Exception:** If a proper noun ends with an *s*, you can either use an apostrophe and *s* or just an apostrophe.  
**Exception:** The possessive of *it* is *its* and doesn't have an apostrophe. Be wary of common mistakes such as confusing *you're* (a contraction for *you are*) with *your*, and *its* with *it's* (a contraction for *it is*).

Don't use an apostrophe with possessive pronouns.  
**Example**  
[warning] Not Recommended: The website is your's. [/warning]  
[tip] Recommended: The website is yours. [/tip]
